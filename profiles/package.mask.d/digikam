# What follows here are digikam-2 and the libraries released together with it.
# In order to build digikam-2, you will have to replace part of your kdegraphics
# libraries with newer versions, which are effectively pre-releases of
# kdegraphics-4.7. Feel free to experiment, but be aware that nobody might be 
# able to help you (or even willing to help you) if problems result...
